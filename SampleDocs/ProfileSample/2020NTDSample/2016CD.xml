        <Description>
            <Abstract>The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and
                cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated
                Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file
                with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an
                independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Congressional Districts are the 435
                areas from which people are elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. After the apportionment of
                congressional seats among the States based on census population counts, each State is responsible for
                establishing congressional districts for the purpose of electing representatives. Each congressional district
                is to be as equal in population to all other congressional districts in a State as practicable. The 116th
                Congress is seated from January 2019 to 2021. The TIGER/Line shapefiles for the District of Columbia, Puerto
                Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the
                U.S. Virgin Islands) each contain a single record for the non-voting delegate district in these areas. The
                boundaries of all other congressional districts reflect information provided to the Census Bureau by the states
                by May 1, 2018</Abstract>
            <Purpose>In order for others to use the information in the Census MAF/TIGER database in a geographic information
                system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the
                database in the form of TIGER/Line Shapefiles.</Purpose>

                    exception to the G-polygon object type classification.  Therefore, when multi-polygons exist in a
                    shapefile, the object count will be less than the actual number of G-polygons</Result>
